# rock-paper-scissors-console

## Description
This is a simple rock, paper, scissors game that can be played in the console for a total of 5 rounds. I made this project while I was self-learning programming through a website called The Odin Project and this was one of the assignments. Through making this, I learned how to write a bit of javascript and strengthened my knowledge on if statements, arrays and loops. I also decided to ensure that whatever word the user wrote when prompted would be case insensitive by making it lowercase and included a score counter.
